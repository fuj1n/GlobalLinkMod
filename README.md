Hello all, this is a mod I have decided to make, it is a globalized chest mod which adds cross-dimensional chests with specific limitations to prevent overpoweredness.

The current code of this mod has several features:
 - A fully functional global chest.
   - A chest that stores items cross-world.
   - An item limitation to the Global Chest is fully implemented[?].
 - A void stone to destroy any junk items you may have on the go.
   - Craft your void stone with any item(s) to destroy them
   - Right click the void stone to open a void stone interface, which has a 3x3 destruction grid(destroys the items in it when the inventory is closed).
 
 My plans for this mod currently include:
   - Rename to Global Link Mod.
   - Add more Global Blocks craftable with Global Links.
   - Add a Void Chest (similar function to void stone). [?]
